#Creating a Data Transformation Pipeline with Cloud Dataprep
#
#
#
# Dataprep by Trifacta ( Starter, Professional, and Enterprise editions )
#------------------------
Dataprep by Trifacta is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data 
for analysis, reporting, and machine learning. 
As Dataprep is serverless and works at any scale, there is no infrastructure to deploy or manage it. 
The next ideal data transformation is suggested and predicted with each UI input.
